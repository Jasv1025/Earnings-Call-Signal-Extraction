The CEO emphasized the importance of innovation and collaboration with partners and customers while expressing a sense of urgency when discussing competition or market shifts.\n\n   New product launches such as Hopper GPU architecture (H100 and H200), Blackwell platform, NVIDIA Inference Microservices (NIM), NVIDIA DRIVE Orin, NVIDIA DRIVE Thor, and Omniverse Cloud APIs were highlighted. The company's focus is on strategic investment priorities in sovereign AI initiatives across the globe, expansion into the Chinese market, accelerated computing, and AI factories.\n\n   During the Q&A sessions, analysts asked about the evolution of NVIDIA's AI technologies, the growth prospects of its data center business, competitive landscape in the generative AI space, monetization strategies for its generative AI technologies, and the expected market growth for generative AI. Jensen Huang, CEO of NVIDIA, responded confidently, expressing pride in the company's achievements while emphasizing the importance of collaboration with partners and customers.\n\n   He explained that the industry is experiencing a major shift as companies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to transform traditional data centers into accelerated computing and AI factories. Generative AI is driving a full-stack computing platform shift, which will transform every computer interaction. The Blackwell platform forms the foundation for trillion-parameter scale generative AI, and Spectrum-X opens a brand-new market for large-scale AI in Ethernet-only data centers. NVIDIA's new software offering, NIMs, delivers enterprise-grade optimized generative AI to run on CUDA everywhere.\n\n   The company monetizes its generative AI technologies through sales of hardware and software solutions to customers across various industries. Jensen Huang expects the generative AI market to grow significantly as more companies adopt this technology across various sectors, with strong demand already being observed from a variety of customers including cloud service providers, consumer Internet companies, enterprise, sovereign AI, automotive, and healthcare customers. However, there is also intense competition in this space, and NVIDIA is continually investing in R&D to stay ahead of the curve."
